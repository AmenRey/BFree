"Response ID","Time Started","Date Submitted","Status","Contact ID","Language","Intro time","Introduction time","Code Instrumentation for IntermittencyWhen we want to transform this simple swap operation to be able to continue where it left off, it needs to be significantly modified.This example is to illustrate the steps required and is therefore not a practical real world example, as transforming every line into a task is often not required. There is no supported way in Python to create a checkpoint and continue on, therefore we split the program into tasks that are assumed to be atomic (they have to be completed before the power fails). After every task (in this case every line in the original swap program is transformed into a separate task) the state of the program and it's variables is stored. And each time a call to `restore()` is made the program continues with the next task. When `checkpoint()` is called the state of the program is stored in non-volatile memory (memory that keeps data even if power is not applied). Bellow there are 3 versions of the same swap program transformed into a task based one. Two of them contain errors in the transformation and one is correct. Please take some time to find which one of the 3 options is the correct one.Option 1Option 2Option 3Please select the option you think is correct.","Instrumentation question time","Intermezzo time","Do you think that a system taking care of program correctness, despite power failures, would help?","Do you think that a system taking care of program correctness, despite power failures, would save your time as a programmer?","Do you think that rewriting a (Python) code such that it will be correct, despite power failures, is a time-consuming task for a programmer?","Do you have any remarks about the problem of intermittent computing?","Final questions time","Considering any programming language: what is your programming experience?","What is your Python language programming experience?","What is your C/C++ programming experience?","Have you ever used any of the open source microcontroller boards such as Adafruit METRO (left) or Arduino Uno (right)?","Have you ever used CircuitPython before?","What is your age?","Self-assessment time"
